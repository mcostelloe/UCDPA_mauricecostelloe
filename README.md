### Final project for 'Introduction to Data Analysis' course at UCDPA

#### GITHUB: https://github.com/mcostelloe/ucd-assignment

This project analyses the relationships/trends that exist between a team's performance metrics and underlying statistics each season for Europe's top 5 leagues (Data range: 2014 - 2019). Luck, as we will refer to throughout this analysis measures the difference between a team's expected stats (expected points, goals & goals against) vs. their actual stats. First we must prove that these underlying statistics are reliable before then measuring them against actual datapoints. We will examine the most dominant teams in Europe year on year by looking at their points, goals & goals conceded per game. Did all of these winners deserve to win every time? We will experiment with their expected points and goals metrics to see if there has been any "Lucky" winners of each domestic league - Measuring the actual quality of their performances and stats along the way.
